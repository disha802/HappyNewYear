Dear Kaustubh,

As this year comes to an end, I wanted to write you something simple and honest.

2025 has been a year of many emotions, lessons, and moments of growth — and you’ve been a meaningful part of it. I’m grateful for the care you’ve shown, the conversations we’ve shared, the laughter, and the effort you’ve put in. Those things mattered to me, and they still do.

As the year closes, I hope the next one brings you clarity, strength, and moments that make you feel steady and fulfilled. You deserve peace and growth in the paths you choose.

Thank you for being part of my year, and for the sincerity you bring into my life.

Wishing you a gentle and good year ahead.

Warm wishes,
"""

Maa,

Everything good in me has traces of you in it.
Thank you for holding the world together without ever asking for credit.

May 2025 give you back a little of the love you pour into everyone else.
Rest a little more. Worry a little less.

Love always,

Pappa,

To the man who taught me strength, silence, and bravery.
I see the things you do for us that go unnoticed.

I hope 2026 brings you as much peace as you provide for our family.
Thank you for being our shield.

Oye,

You’re annoying, but you’re mine.
Grow up a little this year, okay? (But not too much).

I'm always in your corner, even when we fight.
Make this year count.
Don't drive too fast (without me).
And bring me more mentos. 😂
Also no need to flex your height on me, I get it. 😤

Your big sis,
